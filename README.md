* `graph` contains a library to represent and perform transformations on network graphs
* `simulate` is a command-line tool which uses the `graph` library to perform a full simulation
* `convert` is a command-line tool to convert edge-list graph definitions into the format used by `graph/encoding` (and thus required by `analyze` and `simulate`).
* `analyze` is a command-line tool which performs static analysis on network graphs.
